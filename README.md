The Fear of Getting Arrested, Even For No Apparent Reason.

This is a project that came to mind while taking a course with CodePath about a year or two ago (Intro to Web Development). For this project we were meant to choose a first world problem that resonated with us the most and I decided to go with police brutality because it's an ongoing issue that has slowly become a big fear of mine, especially as a black man.

I took a step away from this project (and coding in general) for a while due to a lot of thinking of what I wanted my future career to be and flip-flopping a lot (mainly between coding and video-editing). In the end, I came back to it due to my interest in this setting increasing because of a similar project I started to work on for another friend.

This is the same project, but uses React.js
